# Hi, I'm Mohan 👋

Java Full-Stack Engineer | Spring Boot | Kafka | AWS | Microservices | Distributed Systems | Spring AI | LLMs | RAG | Vector Store

I build production-style systems focused on:
- Event-driven architecture
- Saga pattern (Orchestration & Choreography)
- Kafka reliability (DLQ, Idempotency, Outbox)
- Cloud-native deployments (Docker, Kubernetes, AWS)


## 🚀 Featured Projects

### 1️⃣ Saga Orchestration – Spring Boot + Kafka
Production-style saga implementation with compensation handling and event-driven flow.
👉 https://github.com/rady81/saga-orchestration

### 2️⃣ Event Processing System
Retry, DLQ, Idempotency, Manual Ack, Outbox pattern demo.
👉 https://github.com/rady81/event-processing

### 3️⃣ AWS Lambda + SQS + DLQ + LocalStack
Serverless architecture with idempotency and failure recovery.
👉 https://github.com/rady81/aws-lambda-serverless-patterns

### 4️⃣ Spring AI + LLM Integration
GenAI utility service that estimates LLMs token usage.
👉 https://github.com/rady81/llm-context-window

## 🏗 Architecture Focus

- Microservices with Spring Boot 3
- Kafka (KRaft, partitions, consumer groups, offset control)
- Distributed transaction handling (Saga, Outbox)
- Observability (Actuator, logs, correlation IDs)
- AWS deployments (EC2, Lambda, SQS)
- LLMs, RAG, Vector-search

## 🛠 Run My Projects Locally

Most repositories include:
- Docker Compose
- Kafka (KRaft mode)
- Postgres
- LocalStack (for AWS demos)

Clone → docker compose up → run Spring Boot → test via Postman.
